        <h1>Simply Not So Simple</h1>
        <p>They come here to bike, to take long walks, or to simply enjoy the view. 
        Nearby there is water, a fence before the water, so that it is not dangerous to walk 
        on the road next to the fence, and nearby there are cars. Cars that either zoom
        past you or cars that slowly move beside you. They go where they need to go, whether
        it be the bridge, another borough or another part of Brooklyn. You start walk
        ing and look forward from the beginning of the promenade, or at least my beginning,
        and you’ll see the bridge, the Verrazano bridge. Most of the time there are people 
        walking, or biking and occasionally there will be people fishing. But I wonder if they 
        ever get any fish by fishing there. They sit there, unmoving, blending into the
        scenery.  It’s such a scenic and simple view, no matter where you are on the walk. The 
        bridge is like a halfway point for the promenade. A lot of the time under the bridge,
        people would start to slow down and take breaks. It could be sitting on the benches 
        for a few minutes, or it could just be a simple sip of water. There is also a parking 
        lot nearby where people often park their cars and get out to sit on the grass. 
        Kids often come here to fly kites or their parents would stand by the railing to take
        in the view. Rarely, you’ll catch a photographer with a big camera taking pictures 
        of the area, the bridge, Staten Island, maybe even the boring highway. From the begin
        ning to the bridge is where I see the most calm people. After the bridge to the pier at
        the end, is where I usually see the more competitive people biking, or the people jogging 
        and getting tired as they get closer and closer to their goal. During the summer,
        I would see people here every day sweating heavily, while in the winter, I would see peple
        who would be determined to walk in the cold with their heavy jackets and mittens. Next
        to the promenade is the highway. And next to the highway is the suburban area. While
        driving down the highway, on one side you see the suburban areas, with the houses, the
        trees, the playgrounds, that one small road that you rarely see cars on yet all the spots
        on the road have been fully parked with cars. You take a peek at the other window on
        the other side of the car and you see the promenade, looking further you see water and 
        Staten Island. As you pass by, sitting in your car, the surrounding suburban area and water
        gives you a subtle feeling of calmness, perfectly opposed to the loud, vapid highway. 
        There's something fascinating about the difference between walking and driving in this area.
        Walking feels like a grand adventure and it’s a stroll to the bridge or to the pier or
        who knows where you are going. You always have a destination to go to in the car and the feeling 
        inside the car is completely different from walking. The difference isn’t something
        that can be described in words. I remember the times as a kid learning how to ride a bike 
        with my parents leading and teaching me at the promenade. It was difficult to learn and was
        totally worth it, since it was definitely something more enjoyable than sitting at home all
        the time. It takes like an hour bike ride for me to go from the beginning to the end, which
        was the pier. Occasionally, I’d see people bike to the pier and take a break but I would also
        see so many professionals bike to the end, turn around and immediately start biking back 
        again. Watching people bike really fast made me wish I could be like them one day. As a child,
        it always seemed impossible to bike or to even walk to the very end, since it seemed like
        an extraordinarily long path to go. As I got older, and as the roads changed to be smoother
        and less dangerous over time, I pushed myself to go all the way to the end, and at the end 
        of the day, there was no reason for me to limit myself to only going to the bridge and returning.
        No matter the year, kids and adults just come here to spend time and have fun. The road
        is more than a simple promenade, a highway and the bridge that chops the promenade in half;
        it changes as people grow older and will never stop changing to let people have fun here 
        even if their memories of the area don’t change. It’s never a straight path, with all the twists 
        and turns everywhere. And the road that once allowed bikers and runners to be together 
        separates, but they always come back together in the end.
